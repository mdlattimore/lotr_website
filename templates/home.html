    <h1 class="display-5 text-center">The Verses of Middle Earth</h1><br>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.25em;">TLDR: </span>This little site is a passion project with a simple aim: catalog all the verses of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth (i.e., the poems, songs, incantations, etc., that are written in verse rather than prose) and put them in one place. Why? Well, no good reason for most people. I love collections. I don't know why. I guess I just like things I love at my fingertips (or the click of a mouse). Now start clicking or continue reading if you want to know how this site came about.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.25em;">For those who have longer attention spans, more time, or nothing better to do: </span>When I was in 4th grade (a long, long, long time ago) our teacher would read to us every day after lunch. One of the books she chose was <em>The Hobbit</em>. For weeks, we'd spend half an hour or so with the lights off, heads on our desks, listening to the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and a company of dwarves as they journeyed to reclaim the lost treasure hoarded in the Lonely Mountain. Since that time, I have been enamored by Middle Earth, but not obsessed with it. It would be nine more years before I learned that the tale of Bilbo's big adventure was but one of many stories about this rich and beautiful and dangerous and magical and altogether fascinating world J.R.R. Tolkien created nearly a century ago. I'd never heard of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> before my first year in college (remember, this was pre widespread internet--if you didn't see it with your own eyes or weren't told about it by someone, it didn't exist). But it wasn't until 2006 that I read <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. I was blown away. But I wasn't obsessed.</p>

    <p>Let's face it, trying to read all of ME literature is a commitment, one that's tough to make when you're starting a career and raising young children. However, in the last several years things happened. My kids became adults. I, along with the rest of the world, got to spend an inordinate amount of time at home (think 2020). And I'm at a point in my career where I can afford to make a little more free time.</p>

    <p>Recently, two areas have dominated by reading: poetry and Tolkien. I was never a poetry fan--it all seemed to symbolic or abstract to me--until I read Coleridge's <em>Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em>. Enter the narrative poem. Not a poem that compares anyone to a summer's day or has someone listening to a fly buzz in their final moments. A poem that tells a story, a full-blown narrative (in <em>Rime</em> the poem actually tells a story about someone telling a store--it's all very "inception"). <em>Christabel</em>, <em>Charge of the Light Brigade</em>, <em>The Raven</em>, they all tell compelling stories AND do so using beautifully crafted language.</p>

    <p>But what about Tolkien? As literary world builders go, there is none better. The richness of ME's physical world and its comprehensive social, historical, and supernatural backdrop, complete with developed lore and tradition(s) are enough to draw anyone in to another place and time entirely. Compelling characters, stunning landscapes, stories that touch the deepest part of the human condition, it's difficult not to love Tolkien.</p>

    <p>So what do poetry and Tolkien have to do with each other. Tolkien was a poet and was at his finest when he wove verses into his ME narratives ("verses" meaning all the poems, songs, incantations, etc that are written in verse rather than prose). They aren't presented as fillers or asides, but rather are integral parts of the story, often providing historical and legendary background to the narrative. Their poetic "quality" is, of course, subjective and varied, but I find most of them to be invaluable in evoking emotions that place us, the readers, <em>in</em> the story. They don't just say something about ME or its people or history. They draw us in to ME as participants or, at least, as present specators watching events unfold live. We're not reading the words of dwarvish songs, we hear them being sung. We don't just picture the Lonely Mountain in our mind, we feel the heat of the forge, hear the sounds of hammers on anvils and, ultimately, smell the sulfur of dragon fire.</p>

    <p>You should know, this is by no means a comprehensive catalog of all things Middle Earth (ME). In the process of cataloging these verses, it seemed reasonable to include at least minimal information on characters, places, events, and things to round out the context of these verses, but don't look here for detailed information on the Istari or the origins of the palantiri. They ain't here. There are, however, some excellent online resources that do provide more comprehensive and high quality reference material. In particular, I'd point you to <a href="https://tolkiengateway.net" target="blank">The Tolkien Gateway</a> and <a href="http://lotrproject.com" target="blank">LOTR Project</a> (which has excellent interactive maps and a very interesting section on LOTR statistics -- word frequency, life expectancies, etc).</p>
